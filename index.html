                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a versatile web developer and designer, I possess a range of technical and creative skills that help me craft seamless, responsive, and dynamic websites. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to tackle the full web development process.
                    <br /><br />
                    Front-End Development:
                    I am skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which form the backbone of all my projects. I use Bootstrap to build mobile-first, responsive layouts, while jQuery enhances user interactions with smooth animations and transitions. My proficiency in these tools ensures that I can create user-friendly interfaces that are both visually appealing and functional.
                    <br /><br />
                    Back-End Development:
                    On the back-end, I specialize in PHP and MySQL, developing robust databases and dynamic web applications that scale efficiently. Whether it's creating a custom content management system or integrating external APIs, I ensure the back-end architecture supports a smooth user experience.
                    <br /><br />
                    WordPress and CMS:
                    I am particularly proficient in WordPress, where I build custom themes and plugins to suit specific client needs. From simple business sites to full-scale eCommerce solutions, my work in WordPress ensures that the end product is highly customizable and easy to manage.
                    <br /><br />
                    Design and Tools:
                    While my technical abilities are strong, my design skills also play a crucial role in creating aesthetically pleasing websites. Using Figma, I design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that ensure a smooth browsing experience. This combination of design and development sets my work apart, allowing me to create websites that are not only functional but also visually engaging.
                    <br /><br />
                    By combining my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, WordPress, PHP, MySQL, and Figma, I strive to deliver high-quality websites that meet both user needs and business goals. My goal is to continue pushing the boundaries of web design and development to deliver impactful digital experiences.
